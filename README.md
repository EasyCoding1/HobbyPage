# Odin-Recipes
First attempt at website with function
Had some trouble with getting github linked to this project. Now I have a folder inside a folder hopefully causes no issues.

The above was my original Readme text, almost exactly one month ago from today where I find myself revisiting this page with what
I have learnt since first making it to add a date in JS and make the styling a bit more appealing. I didn't want to change too much, I had considered adding other recipes and effects etc to demonstrate my abilities and aid my application but as said in the founders and coders discord it is also important to show the journey.




I have a really pleasant feeling looking at this website and its simplicity and thinking about how much I have learnt since then. I remember how excited I was when I first managed to center the text, or put a link inside a button. 




Somehow, I am really pleased at how naively excited I was by finishing this first ever webpage. I knew hardly anything then, but I felt so much acomplishment when I completed it.
I still know almost nothing about coding, but I know much more now than I used to- and this page is a reminder that no matter how tough things can be, if I continue to be as excited as I was then at the finish of each step in my learning journey then the only way is up. 




Enjoy the website and maybe chance making one of the dishes yourself, though Gordon Ramsay doesn't look so impressed- be careful!
